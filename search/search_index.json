Goals and audience The primary goal of this guide is to codify and record decisions that Google's Developer Relations group makes about style. The guide can help you avoid making decisions about the same issue over and over, can provide editorial assistance on structuring and writing your documentation, and can help you keep your documentation consistent with our other documentation. Non-goals This guide is for Google-related developer documentation; it doesn't apply to all Google documentation. If you already have your own style guide, it's fine to continue using that. This guide isn't intended to provide an industry documentation standard, nor to compete with other well-known style guides. It's a description of our house style, not a statement that our decisions are objectively correct. This guide isn't intended to provide a complete set of writing guidelines from the ground up. For example, it doesn't cover parts of speech, subject-verb agreement, or other writing basics. This guide is a living document; it changes over time, and when it changes, we generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency to the extent feasible, but at any given time there are certain to be parts of our documentation that don't match this style guide. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing documents. This guide doesn't provide legal advice; legal issues are outside its scope. For issues relating to legal matters, consult your lawyers. In particular, the guidelines in this document don't limit the changes that Google can make to its documentation. Also, if you don't read a given guideline, that doesn't absolve you from behaving ethically and within the law with regard to documentation. How to use the guide If you're looking for a specific topic, then do a search-in-page to see if the topic is mentioned in the left navigation (also known as \"left nav\"). If not, then try using the search box at the top of the page, which is limited by default to search only this guide. This guide is a reference document; instead of reading through it in linear order, you can use it to look up specific issues as needed. If you're new to the style guide and want to get a general sense of what our style is, see the Highlights page. For issues not covered in this guide, see the guides listed in Other Editorial Resources. Breaking the \"rules\" Remember that everything in this guide is a guideline, not a draconian rule. In most contexts, Google has no ability nor desire to enforce these guidelines if they're not appropriate to the context. But we hope that you'll join us in striving for high-quality documentation.

When you're documenting an API, provide a complete API reference, typically generated from source code using doc comments that describe all public classes, methods, constants, and other members. Use the basic guidelines in this document as appropriate for a given programming language. This document doesn't specify how to mark up doc comments; for more information, refer to the specific style guide for each programming language. This page also doesn't cover web APIs. The style suggestions below may be useful to keep in mind while documenting web APIs, but this page doesn't discuss how to write about resources or collections. Documentation basics The API reference must provide a description for each of the following: Every class, interface, struct, and any other similar member of the API (such as union types in C++). Every constant, field, enum, typedef, etc. Every method, with a description for each parameter, the return value, and any exceptions thrown. The following are extremely strong suggestions . In some cases, they don't make sense for a particular API or in a specific language, but in general, follow these guidelines: On each unique page (for a class, interface, etc.), include a code sample (~5-20 lines) at the top. Put all API names, classes, methods, constants, etc. in code font, and link each name to the corresponding reference page. Most document generators do this automatically for you. Put string literals in code font, and enclose them in double quotation marks. For example, XML attribute values might be \"wrap_content\" or \"true\" . Put parameter names in italic. For example, when you refer to the parameters of a method like doSomething(Uri data, int count) , italicize the names data and count . Make sure that the spelling of a class name in documentation matches the spelling in code, with capital letters and no spaces (for example, ActionBar ). Don't make class names plural ( Intents , Activities ); instead, add a plural noun ( Intent objects, Activity instances). However, if a class has a name that's a common term, you can refer to it with the corresponding English word, in lowercase and not in code font (activities, action bar). Classes, interfaces, structs In the first sentence of a class description, briefly state the intended purpose or function of the class or interface with information that can't be deduced from the class name and signature. In additional documentation, elaborate on how to use the API, including how to invoke or instantiate it, what some of the key features are, and any best practices or pitfalls. Many doc tools automatically extract the first sentence of each class description for use in a list of all classes, so make the first sentence unique and descriptive, yet short. Additionally: Do not repeat the class name in the first sentence. Do not say \"this class will/does ....\" Do not use a period before the actual end of the sentence, because some doc generators naively terminate the \"short description\" at the first period. For example, some generators terminate the sentence if they see \"e.g.\", so use \"for example\" instead. The following example is the first sentence of the description for Android's ActionBar class: A primary toolbar within the activity that may display the activity title, application-level navigation affordances, and other interactive items. Members Make descriptions for members (constants and fields) as brief as possible. Be sure to link to relevant methods that use the constant or field. For example, here's the description for the ActionBar class's DISPLAY_SHOW_HOME constant: Show 'home' elements in this action bar, leaving more space for other navigation elements. This includes logo and icon. See also: setDisplayOptions(int) , setDisplayOptions(int, int) Methods In the first sentence for a method description, briefly state what action the method performs. In subsequent sentences, explain why and how to use the method, state any prerequisites that must be met before calling it, give details about exceptions that may occur, and specify any related APIs. Document any dependencies (such as Android permissions ) that are needed to call the method, and how the method behaves if such a dependency is missing (for example, \"the method throws a SecurityException \" or \"the method returns null\"). For example, here's the description for Android's Activity.isChangingConfigurations() method: Checks whether this activity is in the process of being destroyed in order to be recreated with a new configuration. This is often used in onStop() to determine whether the state needs to be cleaned up or will be passed on to the next instance of the activity via onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() . Use present tense for all descriptions. For example: Adds a new bird to the ornithology list. Returns a bird. Description If a method performs an operation and returns some data, start the description with a verb describing the operation. For example: Adds a new bird to the ornithology list and returns the ID of the new entry. If it's a \"getter\" method and it returns a boolean, start with \"Checks whether ....\" If it's a \"getter\" method and it returns something other than a boolean, start with \"Gets the ....\" If it has no return value, start with a verb like one of the following: Turning on an ability or setting: \"Sets the ....\" Updating a property: \"Updates the ....\" Deleting something: \"Deletes the ....\" Registering a callback or other element for later reference: \"Registers ....\" For a callback: \"Called by ....\" (Usually for a method that's named starting with \"on\", such as onBufferingUpdate .) For example, \"Called by Android when ....\" Then, later in the description: \"Subclasses implement this method to ....\" If it's a convenience method that constructs the class object, start with \"Creates a ....\" Parameters For parameter descriptions, follow these guidelines: Capitalize the first word, and end the sentence or phrase with a period. Begin descriptions of non-boolean parameters with \"The\" or \"A\" if possible: The ID of the bird you want to get. A description of the bird. For boolean parameters for requesting an action, start sentences with \"If true ...\" and \"If false ....\" For example: If true, turn traffic lines on. If false, turn them off. For boolean parameters for setting the state of something (not making a request), use the format \"True if ...; false otherwise.\" For example: True if the zoom is set; false otherwise. In this context, don't put the words \"true\" and \"false\" in code font or quotation marks. Return values Be as brief as possible in the return value's description; put any detailed information in the class description. If the return value is anything other than a boolean, start with \"The ....\" For example: The bird specified by the given ID. If the return value is a boolean, use the format \"True if ...; false otherwise.\" For example: True if the bird is in the sanctuary; false otherwise. Exceptions In languages where the reference generator automatically inserts the word \"Throws\", begin your description with \"If ...\" For example: If no key is assigned. Otherwise, begin with \"Thrown when ...\": Thrown when no key is assigned. Deprecations When something is deprecated, tell the user what to use as a replacement. (If you track your API with version numbers, mention which version it was first deprecated in.) Only the first sentence of a description appears in the summary section and index, so put the most important information there. Subsequent sentences can explain why it was deprecated, along with any other information that's useful for a developer using your API. If a method is deprecated, tell the reader what to do to make their code work. Examples Deprecated. Use #CameraPose instead. Deprecated. Access this field using the getField() method.","title":"API reference code comments"},{"location":"style/computer-interface/api-reference-code-comments/#api-reference-code-comments","text":"Summary Provide a complete API reference, describing all relevant aspects of the API, and putting code-related terms in code font.

Note Where documentation is specific to Android, its heading is preceded by . In ordinary text sentences (as opposed to, say, code samples ), use code font to mark up most things that have anything to do with code. In HTML, use the code element; in Markdown, use backticks (```). Some specific items to put in code font Language keywords. Class names. Method and function names. XML and HTML element names. (Also place angle brackets ( ) around the element name; you may have to escape the angle brackets to make them appear in the document.) Attribute names and values. Filenames and paths. Defined (constant) values for an element or attribute. Namespace aliases. HTTP verbs. HTTP status codes. HTTP content-type values. Query parameter names and values. Command-line utility names. DNS record types . Generally don't put quotation marks around an item that's in code font, unless the quotation marks are part of the item. Items to put in ordinary (Roman) font URLs. (But often it's a good idea to put these on a separate line, enclosed in pre , or else to turn them into links. See also the page on link text .) Email addresses. Headings (including table headings). For clarity, where possible, add a noun to the code-related term in the heading: \"Calling the Foo method\"; \"Setting the Bar parameter\". Other HTML elements for code Avoid use of the xmp element; it's deprecated in modern HTML. Use the kbd element to indicate input to be typed (or otherwise entered) by the user. Use the var element to indicate any variable (including both specific variable names from code samples and metasyntactic placeholder variables like foo ). Note that you can use these elements even within a pre block; for example: $ ls filename filename $ Method names When you refer to a method name in text, omit the class name except where including it would prevent ambiguity. For example: Not recommended: To retrieve the zebra's metadata, call its animal.get() method. Recommended: To retrieve the zebra's metadata, call its get() method. Put an empty pair of parentheses after a method name to indicate that it's a method. Placeholder variables To create a placeholder variable, do the following: In HTML, wrap the placeholder variable in a var element. In Markdown, use an underscore before and after the placeholder variable. For placeholder variables, use lowercase characters with hyphen delimiters. For example, in HTML: Not recommended: https://developers.google.com/ API-name https://developers.google.com/ API_name https://developers.google.com/ API name https://developers.google.com/ api_name https://developers.google.com/ apiName Recommended: https://developers.google.com/ api-name https://developers.google.com/ method-name And in Markdown: Not recommended: https://developers.google.com/ API-name https://developers.google.com/ API_name https://developers.google.com/ API name https://developers.google.com/ api_name https://developers.google.com/ apiName Recommended: https://developers.google.com/ api-name https://developers.google.com/ method-name If the context in which your placeholder variables appear makes using lowercase characters with hyphen delimiters a bad idea, use something else that makes sense to you, but be internally consistent. HTTP status codes To refer to a single status code, use the following formatting and phrasing: an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code In particular, call it a \"status code\" instead of a \"response code,\" and put the number and the name in code font. If the \"HTTP\" is implicit from context, you can leave it out. To refer to a range of codes, use the following form: an HTTP 2xx or 400 status code In particular, use \" n xx\" (with a specific digit in place of n ) to indicate \"anything in the n 00- n 99 range,\" and put the status code number in code font even if you're leaving out the code's name. If you prefer to specify an exact range, you can do so: an HTTP status code in the 200 - 299 range Here, too, put the numbers in code font. Coding style guides The following Google coding-style guides are available on GitHub: JavaScript Style Guide . Java Style Guide . C++ Style Guide . Keywords In general, don't use technical keywords as if they were English verbs or nouns. If in some rare cases you do, then don't try to inflect them. Examples Not recommended: POST the data. Recommended: To add the data, send a POST request. Not recommended: Retrieve information by GET ting the data. Recommended: To retrieve the data, send a GET request. Not recommended: Close() ing the file requires you to have open() ed it first. Recommended: You can't close the file before opening it. Also recommended: You can't call the close() method for a file before you call open() . Exception: When documenting a Java API, it's common to leave out words like \"object\" or \"instance\" and instead just use the class name as a noun: \"store the Foo you got from the FooFactory .\" If you need to pluralize such nouns, then add \"object\" or \"instance\": \"store the Foo objects you got from the FooFactory instances.\" Linking API terms in Android When you're writing code comments that you'll turn into generated reference documentation, link to all elements of Android APIs: classes, methods, constants, XML attributes, etc. Use code font and regular HTML a elements to link to this reference material. Link AndroidManifest.xml elements and attributes to the API guide pages. Link the attribute for a particular widget or layout to its Javadoc in the widget or layout's API reference entry. Recommended: a href=\"/guide/topics/manifest/data-element.html\" data /a Very common classes such as Activity and Intent don't need to be linked every time. If you use a term as a concept rather than a class, then don't put it in code font and don't capitalize. Here are some objects that do not always require Javadoc links or capitalization: activity, activities service fragment view loader action bar intent content provider broadcast receiver app widget If you use one of these terms in the context of referring to an actual instance, use the formal class name and link to its reference page. Here are two examples: Recommended: An Activity is an app component that provides a screen with which users can interact ... Recommended: The user interface for an activity is provided by a hierarchy of views---objects derived from the View class. To link to a class or method: To link to a class, use the class name as link text. For example: a href=\"/reference/android/widget/TextView\" TextView /a To link to a method, use the method name as a fragment identifier. If you're linking to a static method, also include the class name in the link text. If you need to distinguish between overloaded versions of a particular method, consider showing the full signature. For example: a href=\"/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)\" onCreate(Bundle) /a To link the attribute for a particular widget or layout to its Javadoc in the widget or layout's API reference entry, use the URL for the page, and then add the fragment identifier #attr_android:*attribute_name* . For example, to link to the XML attribute android:inputType for the TextView widget, add the following: a href=\"/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:inputType inputType /a","title":"Code in text"},{"location":"style/computer-interface/code-in-text/#code-in-text","text":"Summary Use code font for code that appears in text.

Use images only when they provide useful visual explanations of information that is otherwise difficult to express with words, or for screenshots of UIs that are important to the discussion. Some best practices for images. Creating and saving images To create a diagram, use any drawing tool. If you have an SVG file, use it as your image. If you don't have an SVG file, then save your image as a PNG file unless you have a good reason to use a different format. Make your screenshots of windows look like real windows, usually windows from a recent version of macOS unless there's a good reason to use a different operating system. For example, include the window's title bar in the screenshot. And if a given window has a drop shadow, then include the drop shadow in the screenshot as well. Text associated with images Some best practices for text with images: To include an image in your document, wrap your img element in a [figure](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-figure-element) element, with a [figcaption](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-figcaption-element) if appropriate. Recommended figure id = emu-foot img src = /assets/images/emu-foot.svg width = 120 alt = An emu foot has three toes. figcaption b Figure 1. / b Diagram of an emu s foot / figcaption / figure For a figure caption, use the form \" Figure number . Description \". Don't end a figure caption with a period unless the caption ends with a full sentence. Generally try to avoid putting full sentences in captions; full sentences are more appropriate for longdesc and alt text, and for introductory sentences. To refer to a figure, mention it by number (\"figure 1\"), to avoid spatial descriptions (that is, don't say \"the image below\"). As shown above, use an [alt](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt) attribute to provide a text alternative for the image, which is used by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, and might appear if the image cannot load. However, if the image is decorative (not informative) or it's provided only as a visual aid for information that is already expressed in text, then provide empty alternative text ( alt=\"\" ) so it will be ignored by assistive technologies. (If you exclude the alt attribute completely, then screen readers might instead read the filename aloud.) As per the HTML specification , \"the most general rule to consider when writing alternative text is the following: the intent is that replacing every image with the text of its alt attribute not change the meaning of the page.\" So if the alternative text is redundant with surrounding text or it's not useful to visually impaired readers, use the empty tag. In most cases, avoid embedding explanatory text in screenshot graphics; text that's incorporated into a graphic hurts accessibility and increases localization costs. If your text is important enough to be worth embedding, then you can include explanatory text in the image, but in that case, be sure to also provide the same information in a form that people with visual disabilities can use. High-resolution images Modern browsers can use high-resolution images if they are available; this makes the images look better on high-resolution displays. To provide a high-resolution image, use the img element's srcset attribute in addition to the standard src attribute. The srcset attribute lets you specify different image assets for different screen resolutions. It accepts a comma-delimited set of image URLs, with the target screen resolution specified by a size qualifier: 1x meaning the \"standard\" resolution, 2x meaning \"double\" the resolution, and so on. If a web browser supports the srcset attribute, it selects an image from the specified images that's an appropriate resolution for the current display. If the browser doesn't support the srcset attribute, it uses the image in the src attribute. Consequently, you must always still include the src attribute. For example, to provide both a standard resolution image and a double-resolution image, add a srcset attribute and specify both 1x and 2x image assets: img src = /assets/images/skateboard.png srcset = /assets/images/skateboard.png 1x, /assets/images/skateboard_2x.png 2x width = 375 alt = / The width attribute matches the CSS pixel size used for the page dimensions. (The height is automatically calculated based on the width and the image's proportions; don't state it explicitly.) Set the src attribute to point to the standard-resolution ( 1x ) image, not the 2x version. (Almost everyone who has a high-resolution screen also has a modern browser that can recognize the srcset attribute. The src attribute is mainly used by older browsers on low-resolution devices, which should download the smaller, low-resolution image.) Even if your original image is the higher-resolution image, set the src attribute to use the standard-resolution version; don't force a reader using a low-resolution screen to download a graphic that's higher-resolution than they can view. The filename for the double-resolution image (in this case, skateboard_2x.png ) can be anything---it's the \" 2x \" value following the filename that informs the browser which resolution the file is. But it's a good idea to use a filename of the form *basename*_2x.*extension* to make clear to human readers that it's a double-resolution version of *basename.extension* . The double-resolution image must be exactly twice the width and height of the standard image, give or take a pixel. (For example, it's okay for the double-resolution image to be 875x500 and the standard size to be 438x250.) Don't scale up an existing 1x image to make the 2x version. If all you have is the 1x version, then use it alone. But if you're starting with a high-resolution image (at 2x resolution or better), then you can scale it down to appropriate dimensions for 1x and 2x . Currently, only an additional 2x image is necessary, but someday screen PPI may increase further. So the srcset attribute supports further alternative sizes, each specified by the appropriate multiplier, such as 3x or 4x . A browser that supports the srcset attribute uses only the images provided in that attribute---it ignores the src attribute. So specify all available image resolutions in the srcset attribute. Note If you frequently revise an image, then you can use the 2x image for both the src and srcset attributes, rather than maintaining multiple sizes of the image. If things stabilize and you no longer need to revise the image, then you can add a 1x version. For more information, see the HTML specification for the [img](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element) element. Laying out images on a page Don't try to place an image manually; for example, don't use a style attribute or other workarounds to control the image's left/right justification or the margins around the image. Don't make your image too small. It's fine for an image to take up the full width of a page. Consider how the image will look when printed out. In general, don't use an image that's wider than the column it appears in. On developers.android.com , for example, the main-body column is 856px wide, so use images that are no wider than that. In that context, the high-resolution 2x version of the image should be no wider than 1712px. Screenshots at full resolution often take up too much space on the page, so you may have to resize them. If the graphics were created by someone else (for example, a designer on the team you're supporting), it may be fairly trivial for them to provide you with images at the appropriate size. If the images they provide are wider than 856px, ask the designer if they can provide the relevant graphics as 856px/1712px pairs.

Recommended figure id = emu-foot img src = /assets/images/emu-foot.svg width = 120 alt = An emu foot has three toes. figcaption b Figure 1. / b Diagram of an emu s foot / figcaption / figure For a figure caption, use the form \" Figure number . Description \". Don't end a figure caption with a period unless the caption ends with a full sentence. Generally try to avoid putting full sentences in captions; full sentences are more appropriate for longdesc and alt text, and for introductory sentences. To refer to a figure, mention it by number (\"figure 1\"), to avoid spatial descriptions (that is, don't say \"the image below\"). As shown above, use an [alt](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#alt) attribute to provide a text alternative for the image, which is used by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, and might appear if the image cannot load. However, if the image is decorative (not informative) or it's provided only as a visual aid for information that is already expressed in text, then provide empty alternative text ( alt=\"\" ) so it will be ignored by assistive technologies. (If you exclude the alt attribute completely, then screen readers might instead read the filename aloud.) As per the HTML specification , \"the most general rule to consider when writing alternative text is the following: the intent is that replacing every image with the text of its alt attribute not change the meaning of the page.\" So if the alternative text is redundant with surrounding text or it's not useful to visually impaired readers, use the empty tag. In most cases, avoid embedding explanatory text in screenshot graphics; text that's incorporated into a graphic hurts accessibility and increases localization costs. If your text is important enough to be worth embedding, then you can include explanatory text in the image, but in that case, be sure to also provide the same information in a form that people with visual disabilities can use.","title":"Text associated with images"},{"location":"style/formatting-and-organization/figures-and-other-images/#high-resolution-images","text":"Modern browsers can use high-resolution images if they are available; this makes the images look better on high-resolution displays. To provide a high-resolution image, use the img element's srcset attribute in addition to the standard src attribute. The srcset attribute lets you specify different image assets for different screen resolutions. It accepts a comma-delimited set of image URLs, with the target screen resolution specified by a size qualifier: 1x meaning the \"standard\" resolution, 2x meaning \"double\" the resolution, and so on. If a web browser supports the srcset attribute, it selects an image from the specified images that's an appropriate resolution for the current display. If the browser doesn't support the srcset attribute, it uses the image in the src attribute. Consequently, you must always still include the src attribute.

Examples of multiple paragraphs within one item Example of a list item containing more than one paragraph: This list item is a single paragraph. This list item contains multiple paragraphs. As you can see! This is another list item that's only one paragraph long. Introductory sentences for lists In most cases, you should precede a list with an introductory sentence. The sentence can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it immediately precedes the list, usually a period if there's more material (such as a note paragraph) between the introduction and the list.

If the item doesn't include a verb, don't add end punctuation. If the item is entirely in code font, don't add end punctuation. Note These exceptions apply to individual list items, so it's possible to end up with a list that includes some items that end with periods and some that don't.

Note Even though the International System of Units (SI) uses a thin space as a digit group separator, we use a comma, which is the most common digit group separator used in the US. Use a period for a decimal point, also in the standard American style. Examples of comma grouping Not Recommended The limit is 1532784 bytes per day. Recommended The limit is 1,532,784 bytes per day.

List or table? Tables and lists are both ways to present a set of similarly structured items; sometimes it's not obvious when to choose one presentation over the other. To decide which presentation to use, consult the following table: Item type Example How to present Each item is a single unit. A list of programming language names, or a list of steps to follow. Use a numbered list, lettered list, or bulleted list. Each item is a pair of pieces of related data. A list of term/definition pairs. Use a description list. (Or, in some contexts, a table.) Each item is three or more pieces of related data. A set of parameters, where each parameter has a name, a data type, and a description. Use a table. More places not to use tables Some other contexts where it's generally best to avoid tables: Don't use tables to lay out a page; use your site's standard CSS instead. Usually if you have only one row of material, a table isn't the best choice for how to present it. But in some contexts (especially for consistency of layout in reference docs), it may be. If you have only one column in your table, turn the table into a list. Don't use tables to lay out long one-dimensional lists in multiple columns. For example, if you have a long list of function names, don't try to save space by splitting the list in half and presenting the two halves as a two-column table. Use tables only to present two-dimensional data---that is, material that semantically makes sense to display in rows and columns. Multi-paragraph table cells Any table cell can contain more than one paragraph. To create multiple paragraphs, use the p element rather than using the br element. (The HTML specification describes which uses of [br](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-br-element) are legitimate and which aren't.) Example of a table with some cells that contain more than one paragraph: Attribute Name Type Description foo Placeholder Used as a placeholder.

Table placement Some notes on where to place tables: When introducing a table, use a complete sentence and try to refer to the table's position, using a phrase like \"the following table\" or \"the preceding table.\" Don't put a table in the middle of a sentence. If your table refers to footnotes, place them immediately following the table. Table captions If your document contains only one table, the table doesn't need a caption. However, be sure to place the table adjacent to the text that refers to it. If your document contains more than one table in fairly close proximity to each other, include a caption for each one, using a [caption](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-caption-element) element as the first child of the table element. Start the caption with a number, in the form \" Table number . Description \". Use sentence case for the caption, but don't place a period at the end. When referring to the table from text, refer to it by its number. For example: \"... as shown in table 2.\" Your site's CSS determines the styling and placement of the caption. Recommended table caption b Table 1. / b Prehistoric birds / caption ... / table Table formatting Don't add styling to the table element. Table column heads When composing column heads, follow these guidelines: Use sentence case. Write concise headings and omit articles (\"a,\" \"an,\" \"the\"). Don't end with a period or an ellipsis.

Aim, in your documents, for a voice and tone that's conversational, friendly, and respectful without being overly colloquial or frivolous; a voice that's casual and natural and approachable, not pedantic or pushy. Try to sound like a knowledgeable friend who understands what the developer wants to do. Don't try to write exactly the way you speak; you probably speak more colloquially and verbosely than you should write, at least for developer documentation. But aim for a conversational tone rather than a formal one. Don't try to be super-entertaining, but also don't aim for super-dry. Be human, let your personality show, be memorable; you can even be a little funny now and then. But remember that the primary purpose of the document is to provide information to someone who's looking for it. Remember that many readers are not native speakers of English, and that many of them come from cultures different from yours, and that your document may be translated into other languages. Some things to avoid where possible Buzzwords or technical jargon. Being too cutesy. Ableist language or figures of speech. Placeholder phrases like \"please note\" and \"at this time.\" Choppy or long-winded sentences. Starting all sentences with the same phrase (such as \"You can\" or \"To do\"). Current pop-culture references. Jokes at the expense of customers, competitors, or anyone else. Exclamation marks, except in rare really exciting moments. Wackiness, zaniness, and goofiness. Mixing metaphors or taking a metaphor too far. Funny lines that aren't closely related to the topic, or that require a lot of off-topic verbiage, or that obscure information. Phrasing that denigrates or insults any group of people. Phrasing in terms of \"let's\" do something. Using phrases like \"simply\" or \"It's that simple\" or \"It's easy\" in a procedure, unless it's an extraordinarily simple/easy procedure. Internet slang, or other internet abbreviations such as \" tl;dr \" or \" ymmv \". Some techniques and approaches to consider If you're having trouble expressing something, step back and ask yourself, \"What am I trying to say?\" Often, the answer you give yourself reveals what you should be saying in the document. If you're uncertain about your phrasing or tone, ask a colleague to take a look. Try reading parts of your document out loud, or at least mouthing the words. Does it sound natural? Not every sentence has to sound natural when spoken; these are written documents. But if you come across a sentence that's awkward or confusing when spoken, consider whether you can make it more conversational. Use transitions between sentences. Phrases like \"Though\" or \"This way\" can make paragraphs less stilted. (Then again, sometimes transitions like \"However\" or \"Nonetheless\" can make paragraphs more stilted.) Even if you're having trouble hitting the right tone, make sure you're communicating useful information in a clear and direct way; that's the most important part. Politeness and use of \"please\" It's great to be polite, but using \"please\" in a set of instructions is overdoing the politeness. Not Recommended To view the document, please click View .

English is shorter than most languages; an average length English sentence may result in a very long sentence when translated, impairing understanding. Write dates and times in unambiguous and clear ways. Be consistent. For example, if you use a particular term for a particular concept in one place, then use that exact same term elsewhere, including the same capitalization.

This style guide provides a set of editorial guidelines for anyone writing developer documentation for Google-related projects. Goals and audience The primary goal of this guide is to codify and record decisions that Google's Developer Relations group makes about style. The guide can help you avoid making decisions about the same issue over and over, can provide editorial assistance on structuring and writing your documentation, and can help you keep your documentation consistent with our other documentation. Non-goals This guide is for Google-related developer documentation; it doesn't apply to all Google documentation. If you already have your own style guide, it's fine to continue using that. This guide isn't intended to provide an industry documentation standard, nor to compete with other well-known style guides. It's a description of our house style, not a statement that our decisions are objectively correct. This guide isn't intended to provide a complete set of writing guidelines from the ground up. For example, it doesn't cover parts of speech, subject-verb agreement, or other writing basics. This guide is a living document; it changes over time, and when it changes, we generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency to the extent feasible, but at any given time there are certain to be parts of our documentation that don't match this style guide. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing documents. This guide doesn't provide legal advice; legal issues are outside its scope. For issues relating to legal matters, consult your lawyers. In particular, the guidelines in this document don't limit the changes that Google can make to its documentation. Also, if you don't read a given guideline, that doesn't absolve you from behaving ethically and within the law with regard to documentation. How to use the guide If you're looking for a specific topic, then do a search-in-page to see if the topic is mentioned in the left navigation (also known as \"left nav\"). If not, then try using the search box at the top of the page, which is limited by default to search only this guide. This guide is a reference document; instead of reading through it in linear order, you can use it to look up specific issues as needed. If you're new to the style guide and want to get a general sense of what our style is, see the Highlights page. For issues not covered in this guide, see the guides listed in Other Editorial Resources. Breaking the \"rules\" Remember that everything in this guide is a guideline, not a draconian rule. In most contexts, Google has no ability nor desire to enforce these guidelines if they're not appropriate to the context. But we hope that you'll join us in striving for high-quality documentation. A relevant quotation: Quote \"Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\" \u2014George Orwell, \"Politics and the English Language\" Like most style guides, our style guide aims to improve our documentation, especially by improving consistency; therefore, there may be contexts where it makes sense to diverge from our guidelines in order to make your documentation better.","title":"About this Guide"},{"location":"style/introduction/about-this-guide/#about-this-guide","text":"Summary Use this guide as a style reference for our developer documentation.

Avoid internet slang. Abbreviations include acronyms, initialisms, shortened words, and contractions. An acronym is formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but is pronounced as if it were a word itself: NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization . scuba for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus . An initialism is also formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but each letter is pronounced separately: CIA for Central Intelligence Agency . FYI for For Your Information . PR for Public Relations . A shortened word is just part of a word or phrase, sometimes with a period at the end: Dr. for doctor . etc. for et cetera . min for minutes . CA for California . Contractions are discussed in a separate page of this style guide. There's some overlap among those categories. In particular, some abbreviations can be either acronyms or initialisms, depending on the speaker's preference; examples include FAQ and SQL . In some cases, the pronunciation determines whether to use \"a\" or \"an.\" When to spell out a term In general, when an abbreviation is likely to be unfamiliar to the audience, spell out the first mention of the term in the text (not in a heading) and immediately follow with the abbreviation, in parentheses. For all subsequent mentions of the abbreviation, use the abbreviation by itself. Abbreviations not to use Prefer English terms over Latin abbreviations. Don't use \"i.e.\" or \"e.g.\"; instead, use \"that is\" or \"for example,\" respectively. One exception: it's okay to use \"etc.\" in some circumstances . Don't use internet slang abbreviations such as \" tl;dr ,\" \" ymmv ,\" \" RTFM ,\" or others. Write out what you mean in a non-figurative way. Use the most common form of a word. If the full spelled-out word is common and easily understandable, use that rather than abbreviating. For example, write \"approximately\" instead of \"approx.\" Periods with abbreviations Follow these guidelines: Don't use periods with acronyms or initialisms. Put a period at the end of a shortened word, except for date and time abbreviations.

Numbered lists Use a period at the end of each item in a numbered list, except for items that are entirely in code font. Periods with URLs When a period immediately follows a URL (or a file path), it can be hard to tell whether the period is part of the URL. To indicate that the punctuating period isn't part of the URL, try one of the following techniques: Whenever possible, avoid putting URLs in text . Rewrite the sentence so that the URL isn't at the end of the sentence. Put the URL on a separate line from the text, omitting the final period. If the URL is a link, it generally looks different from surrounding text. For example, in most browsers, link text is blue by default. This formatting helps distinguish the URL from the period.

For example, in early 2017, recent O'Reilly and Apress books that we looked at still use the American style. Straight and curly quotation marks Most typefaces support two forms of quotation marks and apostrophes: straight marks and \"curly\" or \"typographic\" marks. Some tools, like Google Docs, automatically convert straight quotation marks and apostrophes to the curly versions as you type. However, our guidance is to always use straight quotation marks and straight apostrophes, for these reasons: It's easy to get the direction of curly quotation marks (especially apostrophes) wrong. Using straight marks avoids this problem. Code requires straight marks. Many writers use coding tools (for example, Subversion) for working directly with markup. Because these tools do not produce curly marks by default, the writer must manually insert the marks, which is error prone.
