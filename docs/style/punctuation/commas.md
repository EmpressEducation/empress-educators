### **Setting off other kinds of clauses**

It's often a good idea to set off certain kinds of clauses with a comma or other punctuation, for clarity.

A couple of specific places where commas are a good idea:

-   In general, put a comma before the word "which" at the start of a nonrestrictive clause. For more on this topic, see this guide's section on [relative pronouns](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#relative-pronouns), and Grammar Girl's page on [which vs that](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/which-versus-that-0?page=all).
-   In general, put a semicolon or a period or a dash before a conjunctive adverb, such as "otherwise" or "however" or "therefore," and put a comma after the conjunctive adverb.

#### **Examples**

!!! failure "Not Recommended" 
    Name of the group which has a maximum length of 200 characters.

!!! success "Recommended" 
    Name of the group, which has a maximum length of 200 characters.

And:

!!! failure "Not Recommended" 
    The variable must have a value otherwise the server returns an error.

!!! success "Recommended" 
    The variable must have a value; otherwise, the server returns an error.
