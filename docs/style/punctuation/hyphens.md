### **When to hyphenate**

Don't hyphenate a word that has a prefix or suffix except in the following situations:

-   Where not doing so could cause confusion; for example, *re-count*, *re-mark*.
-   When a number or a capital letter follows the prefix; for example, *non-English*, *pre-1500*, *post-twelfth graders*.
-   When the prefix ends in a vowel, and the word it precedes starts with the same vowel; for example, *co-op*, *de-energize*.
-   When the prefix is *self*; for example, *self-aware*, *self-important*.
-   When the prefix is followed by a word that is already hyphenated.
-   When the prefix is followed by a compound word that contains a space. In this case, the space is replaced with a hyphen; for example, *twentieth century* but *pre-twentieth-century music*.

___

### **Compound words**

Compound words are two or more words that are joined to form a new word. To determine whether to hyphenate a compound word, check the [word list](https://developers.google.com/style/wordlist.html). If it's not in the word list, check a dictionary.

___

### **Range of numbers**

Use a hyphen to indicate a range of numbers. Don't add words such as *from* or *between*.

#### Examples

!!! failure "Not Recommended" 
    from 8-20 files

!!! success "Recommended" 
    8-20 files

___

### **Spaces around hyphens**

Never place a space on either side of a hyphen except when using a [suspended hyphen](https://developers.google.com/style/hyphens#suspended-hyphens), in which case you can leave a space after (but not before) the hyphen.

___

### **Suspended hyphens**

When two or more compound modifiers have a common base, you can keep the hyphens but leave out the base for all except the last modifier. In the following example, the base is "hour."

#### Example

!!! success "Recommended" 
    You can set up the system to scan for new files at one-, two-, or three-hour intervals.

!!! note "Note" 
    Hyphens are not dashes; don't use them interchangeably. For information about dashes, see [Dashes](https://developers.google.com/style/dashes.html).
