# **Periods**

!!! Summary 
    End a complete sentence with a period, unless it's a question.

___

### **Periods with lists**

Whether to end a list item with a period depends on several factors, including the kind of list that the item appears in.

For more information about lists, see [Lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists).

___

#### **Description lists**

Don't put a period at the end of a term. (That is, at end of an item in a `<dt>` element.)

Do put a period at the end of a description. (That is, at the end of an item in a `<dd>` element.)

___

#### **Bulleted lists**

Use a period at the end of each item in a bulleted list, except for items that are entirely in code font.

___

#### **Numbered lists**

Use a period at the end of each item in a numbered list, except for items that are entirely in code font.

___

### **Periods with URLs**

When a period immediately follows a URL (or a file path), it can be hard to tell whether the period is part of the URL.

To indicate that the punctuating period isn't part of the URL, try one of the following techniques:

-   Whenever possible, avoid putting [URLs in text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text).
-   Rewrite the sentence so that the URL isn't at the end of the sentence.
-   Put the URL on a separate line from the text, omitting the final period.

If the URL is a link, it generally looks different from surrounding text. For example, in most browsers, link text is blue by default. This formatting helps distinguish the URL from the period.

!!! note "Note" 
    When you do put a period after a URL, don't leave any space between the last character of the URL and the period.

___

### **Periods with quotation marks**

When a sentence ends with material inside quotation marks, place the period inside the quotation marks even if the period isn't part of the material inside the quotation marks.

If the material inside the quotation marks ends with a question mark or an exclamation point, don't use a period.

#### **Examples**

!!! success "Recommended" 
    ... in front of a vowel sound, use "an."

!!! success "Recommended" 
    Children always ask "Why?"

For more information about quotation marks, see [Quotation Marks](https://developers.google.com/style/quotation-marks).

___

### **Periods with parentheses**

If the last part of a sentence is contained inside parentheses, put the period after the closing parenthesis.

If the parentheses contain a complete sentence, put the period inside the parentheses.

#### **Examples**

!!! success "Recommended" 
    Your application could show a notification when a relevant file or folder has changed (even if that change occurs while your application isn't running).

!!! success "Recommended" 
    App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale. (With App Engine, there are no servers for you to maintain.)
