# **Parenthesis**

!!! Summary 
    Use parentheses judiciously.

Some of us love to use parentheses. Unfortunately, some readers ignore anything that appears in parentheses, so don't put important information in parentheses if you can help it.

And even for less important information, whenever you're inclined to use parentheses, consider whether they're necessary. Sometimes they are; but sometimes the sentence or paragraph works just as well if you remove the parentheses and set off the phrase or sentence using commas, dashes, semicolons, or periods.

!!! note "Note" 
    If a full standalone sentence appears inside parentheses, the period also goes inside the parentheses, not outside.
