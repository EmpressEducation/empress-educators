# **Contractions**

!!! Summary 
    In general, it's OK to use contractions; but be wary of certain kinds of contractions.

Because we write our documentation in an informal [tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone), feel free to use most types of contractions.

___

### **Negation contractions**

In particular, it's fine to use "-n't" contractions, such as "isn't," "don't," and "can't."

One reason that such contractions are useful: it's sometimes easy for a reader to miss the word "not," whereas it's harder to misread "don't" as "do."

___

### **Noun+verb contractions**

In general, avoid contractions formed from nouns and verbs.

#### **Examples**

!!! failure "Not Recommended"
    The browser's fast, simple, and secure.

!!! success "Recommended"
    The browser is fast, simple, and secure.

The second example above is better because using *'s* in place of *is* could cause the reader to think that "browser's" is the possessive form.

In some cases, it's OK to use a noun+verb contraction, such as "If you want to display information, a table's your best option." But in general, it's best to avoid that kind of contraction.

#### **Examples**

!!! failure "Not Recommended"
    The following guides're a good way to learn to use Universal Analytics.

!!! success "Recommended"
    The following guides are a good way to learn to use Universal Analytics.

Here, "guides're" just sounds clunky and weird.

### **Don't use double contractions**

Double contractions contain not just one but two contracted words. Some examples of double contractions are as follows:

-   mightn't've (mightn't have → might not have)
-   mustn't've (mustn't have → must not have)
-   wouldn't've (wouldn't have → would not have)
-   shouldn't've (shouldn't have → should not have)

### **Its and it's**

Don't confuse *its* with *it's*. It's just not right!
