# Clause order

!!! Summary 
    Put conditional clauses before instructions, not after.

Say you want to tell the audience to do something in a particular circumstance. If possible, mention the circumstance before you provide the instruction; that way, the reader can skip the instruction if the circumstance doesn't apply.
