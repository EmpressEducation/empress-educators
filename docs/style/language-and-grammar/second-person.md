# Second person

!!! Summary 
    Use "you" rather than "we."

In general, use second person in your eLearning rather than first person---"you" (sometimes implicit) instead of "we."

It's also important to figure out who the "you" is that you're addressing (the student? a friend? a relative? someone else?), and to be consistent about that. Make it clear to the student who you expect them to be (sometimes with an explicit "Audience" section near the beginning of the instruction).

Example of "we" vs "you":

!!! failure "Not Recommended"  
    If we're deleting multiple entries at a time ...

!!! success "Recommended" 
    If you're deleting multiple entries at a time ...

!!! success "Recommended" 
    When deleting multiple entries at a time ...

(But if you're using an implicit "you" like the one in that last example, be sure that it's clear who's doing the deleting.)

In an instruction, leave out the "you." For example:

!!! failure "Not Recommended"  
    Let's click **Submit** now.

!!! failure "Not Recommended"  
    We now click **Submit**.

Slightly better: You now click **Submit**.

!!! success "Recommended" 
    Click **Submit**.

This issue can also interact with tense:

!!! failure "Not Recommended"  
    You'll need to create an XML entry.

!!! success "Recommended"
    Create an XML entry.

If you have to use "we," it's better to use the active-voice "We recommend" than the less direct "It is recommended."

However, it's generally best to avoid "our". For example:

!!! failure "Not Recommended"
