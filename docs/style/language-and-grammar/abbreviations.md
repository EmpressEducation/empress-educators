# **Abbreviations**

!!! Summary 
    Use standard American abbreviations. Avoid internet slang.

Abbreviations include acronyms, initialisms, shortened words, and contractions.

-   An acronym is formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but is pronounced as if it were a word itself:
    -   *NATO* for *North Atlantic Treaty Organization*.
    -   *scuba* for *self-contained underwater breathing apparatus*.
-   An initialism is also formed from the first letters of words in a phrase, but each letter is pronounced separately:
    -   *CIA* for *Central Intelligence Agency*.
    -   *FYI* for *For Your Information*.
    -   *PR* for *Public Relations*.
-   A shortened word is just part of a word or phrase, sometimes with a period at the end:
    -   *Dr.* for *doctor*.
    -   *etc.* for *et cetera*.
    -   *min* for *minutes*.
    -   *CA* for *California*.
-   [Contractions](https://developers.google.com/style/contractions) are discussed in a separate page of this style guide.

There's some overlap among those categories. In particular, some abbreviations can be either acronyms or initialisms, depending on the speaker's preference; examples include *FAQ* and *SQL*. In some cases, the pronunciation determines [whether to use "a" or "an."](https://developers.google.com/style/articles)

### **When to spell out a term**

In general, when an abbreviation is likely to be unfamiliar to the audience, spell out the first mention of the term in the text (not in a heading) and immediately follow with the abbreviation, in parentheses. For all subsequent mentions of the abbreviation, use the abbreviation by itself.

### **Abbreviations not to use**

Prefer English terms over Latin abbreviations. Don't use "i.e." or "e.g."; instead, use "that is" or "for example," respectively. One exception: it's [okay to use "etc." in some circumstances](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#etc).

Don't use internet slang abbreviations such as "[tl;dr](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#tldr)," "[ymmv](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#ymmv)," "[RTFM](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#rtfm)," or others. Write out what you mean in a non-figurative way.

Use the most common form of a word. If the full spelled-out word is common and easily understandable, use that rather than abbreviating. For example, write "approximately" instead of "approx."

### **Periods with abbreviations**

Follow these guidelines:

-   Don't use periods with acronyms or initialisms.
-   Put a period at the end of a shortened word, except for [date and time](https://developers.google.com/style/dates) abbreviations.
-   Don't use a period with an abbreviation for the name of a US state or the District of Columbia (DC).
