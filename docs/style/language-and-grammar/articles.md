# **Articles (a, an, the)**

!!! Summary 
    Include definite and indefinite articles in your eLearning, and use them correctly.

For ease of comprehension and translation, include *a*, *an*, and *the* in your eLearning.

*A* and *an* are indefinite articles and are used before a singular noun. They refer to any member of a group.

*The* is a definite article. It is used before singular and plural nouns and refers to one or more particular members of a group.

Whether to use "a" or "an" depends on the pronunciation of the word that follows it. Use "a" before any consonant sound; use "an" before any vowel sound.

#### **Examples**

-   An hour.
-   An HTML file.
-   A hand.
-   A hotel.
-   An umbrella.
-   A union.

To complicate matters further, some abbreviations can be both acronyms and initialisms, requiring *a* in one instance and *an* in the other. For example, *FAQ*, which some pronounce "fak" and others spell out, requires *an* when spelled out and *a* when pronounced as a word. The following is a list of these kinds of abbreviations with our recommendations for which article to use:

-   An SQL (database).
-   An FAQ.
