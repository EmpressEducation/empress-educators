### **Capitalization in titles and headings**

In document titles and page headings, use sentence case. That is, capitalize only the first word.

Exception: for proper nouns, trademarks, keywords, and other terms that are always capitalized a certain way, use the standard capitalization for the term, regardless of where it appears in the title or heading.

Even though you're using sentence case, don't put a period at the end of a heading.
