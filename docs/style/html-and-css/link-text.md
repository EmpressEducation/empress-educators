# **Link text**

!!! Summary 
    Use descriptive link text that is helpful to the reader.

When you're writing link text, use a phrase that describes what the reader will see after following the link. That can take either of two forms:

-   The exact title of the linked-to page, capitalized the same way the title is capitalized.
-   A description of the linked-to page, capitalized like ordinary text instead of like a title.

Sometimes you have to rework a sentence to include a phrase that makes good link text.

For more suggestions about best practices for link text, see the article at Webcredible on [writing effective link text](http://www.webcredible.com/blog/writing-effective-link-text/) (but ignore the "no more than four words" rule), and Jed Hartman's [blog post on link text](https://www.kith.org/jed/2004/12/09/link-text/).

A couple of specific things to *not* do in link text:

-   Don't use the phrase "click here." (It's bad for accessibility and bad for scannability.)
-   Similarly, don't use phrases like "this document." (It's easy to read "this" as meaning "the one you're reading now" rather than "the one I'm pointing to.")
-   Don't use a URL as link text. Instead, use the page title or a description of the page.

### **Punctuation with links**

If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags where possible. In particular, put quotation marks outside of link tags.
