### **Avoid ableist language**

When trying to achieve a [friendly and conversational tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone), problematic ableist language may slip in. This can come in the form of figures of speech and other turns of phrase. Be sensitive to your word choice, especially when aiming for an informal tone. Ableist language includes words or phrases such as *crazy*, *insane*, *blind to* or *blind eye to*, *cripple*, *dumb*, and others. Choose alternative words depending on the context. For example:

!!! failure "Not recommended" 
     There are some crazy outliers in the data.

!!! success "recommended" 
     There are some baffling outliers in the data.

!!! failure "Not recommended" 
     It cripples the service, and users will need to wait until the queue clears.

!!! success "recommended" 
     It slows down the service, and users will need to wait until the queue clears.

### **Avoid unnecessarily gendered language**

In addition to being mindful of the [pronouns](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#gender-neutral-pronouns) used in narrative examples, be sensitive to other possible sources of gendered language.

!!! failure "Not recommended"

     This API might be just what your globally conscious company needs to help all of mankind.

### **Write diverse and inclusive examples**

Use diverse names, genders, and locations in examples. Keep the following advice in mind:

-   Follow our [gender-neutral pronoun](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#gender-neutral-pronouns) guidance.
-   Avoid being too culturally specific to the US. Be mindful when referring to specific holidays, cultural practices, sports, figures of speech, etc. Being sensitive here also supports [writing for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation.html#culturally-specific).
-   Take care to [choose a diverse set of names](https://developers.google.com/style/examples.html#names) to help examples reflect the real world diversity of our audience.
