# **Accessible Content**

!!! Summary 
    Create eLearning that is accessible not only to people with disabilities but also to an international audience and those who use older technology and different browsers.

Most of the principles that apply to good eLearning also apply to accessible eLearning:

-   Use correct grammar and punctuation.
-   Use active voice and present tense.
-   Write clear, simple sentences.
-   Be consistent.
-   Avoid jargon, slang, and the like.
-   Beware of dangling modifiers.
-   Use the relative pronoun "that" where you might otherwise omit it.

-   Use the simplest terminology.
-   Use colors judiciously:
    -   Keep in mind that some color-blind people cannot tell red from green.
    -   Make sure that your text color contrasts sufficiently with your background color.
