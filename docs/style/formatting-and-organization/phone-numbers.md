### **Formatting real phone numbers**

In the rare case when you're providing a real phone number to contact a real person, use the following formats, depending on whether the number is in North America or elsewhere.

#### **North American phone numbers**

To format phone numbers in the USA, Canada, and other [NANP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan) (North American Numbering Plan) countries, enclose the area code in parentheses followed by a space, and then hyphenate the three-digit exchange code with the four-digit number.

##### **Example**

    (415) 555-0132

#### **International phone numbers**

To format phone numbers in non-NANP countries, include the country and area codes. Separate the groups of numbers with spaces. Insert a plus sign immediately before the country code (no space); the plus sign stands in for a prefix known as an *exit code*, which lets you dial out of a country. Each country has a different exit code.

For more information, see the [ITU document on standardized formatting for phone numbers](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.123-200102-I/en).
