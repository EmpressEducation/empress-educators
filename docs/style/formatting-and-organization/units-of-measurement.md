In some contexts, it may be appropriate to indicate thousands of something by following a number with a lowercase "k". If you do that, then follow these guidelines:

-   Don't put a space between the number and "k".
-   Add a noun to indicate what the number measures, and to make clear that you're not using "k" as an abbreviation for "kilobytes."
