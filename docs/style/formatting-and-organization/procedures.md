# **Procedures**

!!! Summary 
    A procedure is a sequence of numbered steps for accomplishing a task.

___

### **Introductory sentences**

In most cases, introduce a procedure with an introductory sentence. The sentence can end with a colon or a period; usually a colon if it immediately precedes the procedure, usually a period if there's more material (such as a note paragraph) between the introduction and the procedure.

Don't introduce a procedure with a partial sentence that's completed by the numbered steps.

### **Sub-steps in numbered procedures**

In a numbered procedure, sub-steps are labeled with lowercase letters, and sub-sub-steps get lowercase Roman numerals.

When a step has sub-steps, treat the step like an [introductory sentence](https://developers.google.com/style/procedures#introductory-sentences): put a colon or a period at the end of the step, as appropriate.

        1.  Do the first sub-part of foo part two.
        2.  Do the second sub-part of foo part two.
2.  Next, do bar.

### **More guidelines for writing procedures**
