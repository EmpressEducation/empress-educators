# Welcome to Empress Educators

This style guide provides a set of guidelines for anyone creating eLearning for Empress-related projects.

## Goals and audience

The primary goal of this guide is to record decisions that the Empress Educators group make about style. The guide can help you avoid making decisions about the same issue over and over, can provide editorial assistance on structuring and creating your eLearning programs, and can help you keep your programs consistent.

#### **Non-goals**

This guide is for Empress-related eLearning; it doesn't apply to all Empress material. If you already have your own style guide, it's fine to continue using that.

This guide isn't intended to provide an industry standard, nor to compete with other well-known style guides. It's a description of our house style, not a statement that our decisions are objectively correct.

This guide isn't intended to provide a complete set of eLearning guidelines from the ground up. There are many topics we'd like to cover and some we may not cover at all. We'll work to ensure supporting material is available for topics that we do not yet cover effectively.

This guide is a living document; it changes over time, and when it changes, we generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency to the extent feasible, but at any given time there are certain to be parts of our eLearning that don't match this style guide. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing eLearning materials.

### **How to use the guide**

If you're looking for a specific topic, then do a search-in-page to see if the topic is mentioned in the left navigation (also known as "left nav"). If not, then try using the search box at the top of the page, which is limited by default to search only this guide.

This guide is a reference document; instead of reading through it in linear order, you can use it to look up specific issues as needed.

If you're new to the style guide and want to get a general sense of what our style is, see the Highlights page.

For issues not covered in this guide, see the guides listed in Other Editorial Resources.

### **Breaking the "rules"**

Remember that everything in this guide is a guideline, not a rule. In most contexts, Empress has no ability nor desire to enforce these guidelines if they're not appropriate to the context. But we hope that you'll join us in striving for high-quality eLearning experiences. A relevant quotation:

!!! Quote
    "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."
    â€” Nelson Mandela

Our style guide aims to improve our approach to eLearning, especially by improving consistency; therefore, there may be contexts where it makes sense to diverge from our guidelines in order to make your eLearning better.
