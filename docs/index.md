# Welcome 

This style guide provides a set of guidelines for anyone creating education for Empress-related projects.

## Goals and audience

The primary goal of this guide is to record decisions that the Empress Educators group make about style. The guide can help you avoid making decisions about the same issue over and over, can provide editorial assistance on structuring and creating your educational programs, and can help you keep your programs consistent.

### Non-goals

This guide isn't intended to provide an industry educational standard, nor to compete with other well-known style guides. It's a description of our house style, not a statement that our decisions are objectively correct.

This guide isn't intended to provide a complete set of educational guidelines from the ground up. For example, there are many things it does not cover, but an effort is made in these cases to provide external resources where it is helpful.

This guide is a living document; it changes over time, and when it changes, we generally don't change previously published documentation to match. We strive for consistency to the extent feasible, but at any given time there are certain to be parts of our documentation that don't match this style guide. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing documents.

This guide doesn't provide legal advice; legal issues are outside its scope. For issues relating to legal matters, consult your lawyers. In particular, the guidelines in this document don't limit the changes that Empress can make to its documentation. Also, if you don't read a given guideline, that doesn't absolve you from behaving ethically and within the law with regard to documentation.

## How to use the guide

If you're looking for a specific topic, then do a search-in-page to see if the topic is mentioned in the left navigation (also known as "left nav"). If not, then try using the search box at the top of the page, which is limited by default to search only this guide.

This guide is a reference document; instead of reading through it in linear order, you can use it to look up specific issues as needed.

If you're new to the style guide and want to get a general sense of what our style is, see the Highlights page.

For issues not covered in this guide, see the guides listed in Other Editorial Resources.

## Breaking the "rules"

Remember that everything in this guide is a guideline, not a draconian rule. In most contexts, Empress has no ability nor desire to enforce these guidelines if they're not appropriate to the context. But we hope that you'll join us in striving for high-quality education. A relevant quotation:

    "Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."

    â€”George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language"

Like most style guides, our style guide aims to improve our education, especially by improving consistency; therefore, there may be contexts where it makes sense to diverge from our guidelines in order to make your education better.
