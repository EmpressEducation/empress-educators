| Learning Objectives | Define learning objectives at project levelDefine learning objectives to be met to show mastery of skillsDetermine actions,by student that show measurable outcomes                                                                      |
| Brainstorm          |  Collect project ideas and decide on one the student should complete - Brainstorm project ideas that could help student meet their goals - Narrow down to a single best idea to develop further                                          |
| Prototype           |  Build a low fidelity version of this project - Create example that shows what student will build - Alert student services to begin sourcing reviewers and mentorsReview and iterate until project idea is agreed on                     |
| Rubric              |  Define criteria by which student submissions will be graded - Identify the project assessment criteria - Define criteria where project meets specifications - Define criteria where project does not meet specifications                |
| Final Version       |  Build final version of project from original prototype - Refine project goals and align to student objectivesSource all supporting material for project - Connect project to all dependencies and clear final blockers                  |
| Project Materials   |  Create project description and directions, and supporting materials - Create instructions for students to get started - Develop any starter code or materials student will need                                                         |
| Examples            |  Create successful and unsuccessful version of project - Develop complete project example that meets expectations   - Develop complete project example that does NOT meet expectations - Document why example does NOT meet expectations |
| Build Classroom     |  Setup project in classroom and prepare for first students - Build project, rubric, resources, and examples into classroom - QA submission process and ensure project is ready to launch                                                 |
| Beta-test           |  Get first students into classroom to complete and review the project - Beta testers have completed the project - Feedback reviewed and incorporated                                                                                     |
